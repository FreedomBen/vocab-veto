# Banned Words Service — Implementation Plan

A concrete, milestone-ordered plan for building the service specified in [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md). Each milestone is independently shippable and verifiable.

## Conventions

- Rust edition 2021, stable toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- Formatting: `cargo fmt` (default config). Lints: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`.
- CI runs `fmt --check`, `clippy`, `test`, `bench --no-run`, and builds the container image.
- Every milestone ends with: code compiles, lints clean, tests pass, docs updated.

## Milestone 1 — Scaffold and build-time codegen

**Goal.** Empty binary that loads the LDNOOBW list at compile time.

1. `cargo init --bin`; commit `Cargo.toml` skeleton, workspace-free.
2. Add submodule: `git submodule add https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words vendor/ldnoobw`; pin to `5faf2ba42d7b1c0977169ec3611df25a3c08eb13` (LDNOOBW default-branch HEAD as of scaffold) and surface the SHA as `LIST_VERSION` in the generated terms file. Re-pinning later is a deliberate, release-worthy act — not routine maintenance.
3. `build.rs`:
   - Walk `vendor/ldnoobw/`, pick up per-language files (`en`, `es`, …).
   - Emit the generated file to `$OUT_DIR/generated_terms.rs` (pulled in from `src/matcher/mod.rs` via `include!`). Never write into the source tree — that dirties the working copy, races cargo's rerun detection, and breaks the reproducible-build claim in M9. The file contains:
     - `pub const LIST_VERSION: &str = "<SHA>";`
     - `pub static TERMS: phf::Map<&'static str, &'static [&'static str]>` keyed by lowercase ISO code.
   - Emit `cargo:rerun-if-changed=vendor/ldnoobw` and on the submodule HEAD.
4. Hello-world `main.rs` that prints `LIST_VERSION` and term counts per language. Smoke-test: `cargo run` prints something plausible.

**Exit criteria.** `cargo build` green; `LIST_VERSION == "5faf2ba42d7b1c0977169ec3611df25a3c08eb13"`; term counts sum to the expected ~5k.

## Milestone 2 — Matching core (library)

**Goal.** A pure-Rust matching engine, unit-tested in isolation from HTTP.

1. `matcher::normalize`:
   - NFKC via `unicode-normalization`, lowercased via `caseless`.
   - Returns `(String normalized, Vec<u32> offset_map)` where `offset_map[i]` is the starting byte offset in the original text for normalized-byte `i`. Single-pass.
   - Reject on length: normalized > 192 KiB → caller translates to 413.
2. `matcher::boundary`: `is_word_boundary(s: &str, byte_idx: usize) -> bool` per UAX #29, using `unicode-segmentation`.
3. `matcher::scan`:
   - `Engine::new(langs: &HashMap<Lang, &[&str]>) -> Engine` builds one `AhoCorasick` per lang with `MatchKind::LeftmostLongest`, non-overlapping.
   - `Engine::scan(text: &str, langs: &[Lang], mode: Option<Mode>) -> ScanResult { mode_used, matches, truncated }`. `mode = Some(m)` applies `m` uniformly to every scanned language (including CJK — no clamping) and echoes `m` in `mode_used` for each; `mode = None` looks each lang up in the `DEFAULT_MODE` table (populated in M4) and echoes the resolved value. `mode_used` always has one entry per scanned language.
   - Both modes share the same per-language `AhoCorasick`; strict mode is a **post-match boundary filter** over the hits produced by the shared automaton, not a second automaton. Keeps hot-path memory flat regardless of which mode a request picks.
   - Span widening across NFKC expansions as specified in DESIGN §"Mapping across NFKC expansions".
   - 256-match cap applied *after* concatenation in caller-supplied `langs` order (alphabetical when omitted).
4. Unit tests covering: ASCII strict vs substring, fullwidth evasion, ligature expansion (`ﬁ`), CJK substring, Scunthorpe case, truncation boundary at exactly 256 and 257 hits. Empty-text rejection lives at the handler (DESIGN §"text — string, required" — the ≥1-byte check runs on raw input before normalization) and is covered by the M3 integration tests, not here.

**Exit criteria.** `cargo test --lib` green; criterion bench skeleton compiles.

## Milestone 3 — HTTP surface (happy path)

**Goal.** `/v1/check` end-to-end for a single language (`en`), `/v1/languages`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`.

1. `config.rs`:
   - `BWS_LISTEN_ADDR`: HTTP listen address. Defaults to `0.0.0.0:8080` when unset — matches DESIGN §Deployment, and keeps `cargo run` and local Docker usage working with only `BWS_API_KEYS` set.
   - `BWS_API_KEYS`: **required**. Parse per DESIGN §Deployment — split on `,`, trim surrounding ASCII whitespace from each entry, reject empty entries, deduplicate, reject any entry that itself contains `,`; warn (do not reject) on entries shorter than 32 bytes. Unset / empty / zero-keys after parsing is a fatal startup error with a clear message.
   - `BWS_LANGS`: optional runtime allowlist (unknown-code handling lands in M4).
   - `BWS_MAX_INFLIGHT`: default `1024`.
   Config unit tests cover each `BWS_API_KEYS` rule independently: whitespace trim, empty-entry rejection, dedup, comma-in-key rejection, short-key warning emission, zero-keys fatal.
2. `auth.rs`: extract `Authorization: Bearer <k>`, compare each candidate via `subtle::ConstantTimeEq`, **always iterating the full set**. Log `key_id = hex(sha256(key))[..8]` on success; log only `reason` on failure.
3. `error.rs`: single `ApiError` enum → `IntoResponse` producing `{error, message}` with the right status. `X-List-Version` attachment is **not** done here — it lives in a response-layer middleware scoped to the `/v1` sub-router (see item 7), so `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics` do not carry the header while every `/v1/*` response (success, 4xx including fast-pathed 401, and 5xx) does.
4. `matcher::DEFAULT_MODE: phf::Map<&str, Mode>` — space-delimited langs → `Strict`, CJK (`ja`, `zh`, `ko`) → `Substring`. Full table lands here (pulled forward from M4) even though only `en` is actively loaded in M3, so `routes/languages.rs` can serve its canonical shape from day one. M4 then adds languages to the automaton map without churning the `/v1/languages` response contract.
5. `routes/check.rs`: deserialize `CheckRequest`, validate, call `Engine::scan`, serialize `CheckResponse`. `mode_used` populated for every requested language.
6. `routes/languages.rs`: response from the compiled table in alphabetical order by ISO code, shape `[{code, default_mode}, ...]`, restricted to languages currently in the automaton map. `default_mode` is sourced from `matcher::DEFAULT_MODE`.
7. `routes/health.rs`: `/healthz` always returns 200. `/readyz` returns 200 with `{ "ready": true, "list_version": "<SHA>", "languages": N }` once all automatons are built, else 503 with `{ "ready": false }`. The listener binds only *after* the engine is ready, so the 503 state is essentially unobservable in practice — still implemented for correctness and for operators inspecting a sidecar that races startup.
8. Middleware stack, ordered outermost → innermost (first to see the request first): request-id → `tracing` span → RED metrics layer (M6) → `X-List-Version` injector (scoped to the `/v1` router) → auth (fast 401 before body work) → raw body-size limit (64 KiB, `tower_http::limit::RequestBodyLimitLayer`) → in-flight gate (M5; `/v1/check` only) → handler. This ordering realises the DESIGN invariants that 401 runs before body parse and before the gate, and that fast-pathed 401s still carry `X-List-Version` and still increment the RED series.
9. Integration tests via `axum::Router::oneshot` for: auth missing/invalid/valid, body too large, malformed JSON, empty `text`, empty `langs`, unknown language, happy path.

**Exit criteria.** `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $K" -d '{"text":"..."}' :8080/v1/check` returns the documented shape.

## Milestone 4 — Multi-language and mode defaults

**Goal.** All LDNOOBW languages loaded; per-language mode default table wired up.

1. Load all LDNOOBW languages (subject to `BWS_LANGS` in the next item) into the automaton map at startup; M3 ran with only `en`, and `DEFAULT_MODE` is already in place from M3.
2. `langs` defaulting: when omitted, scan every loaded language in alphabetical order.
3. `mode` defaulting: per-language lookup via `matcher::DEFAULT_MODE`, echoed in `mode_used`. Explicit caller mode wins, including `strict` on CJK (no clamping).
4. `BWS_LANGS` runtime allowlist: fatal startup error on unknown codes, with a helpful message listing compiled codes.
5. Tests: mixed-language request, default vs explicit mode parity, CJK-strict honored, `BWS_LANGS` trimming and dedup.

**Exit criteria.** A single request across `en,ja,zh` returns a well-formed `mode_used` map and correctly-ordered matches.

## Milestone 5 — Limits, backpressure, and error surface

**Goal.** Every documented error code is reachable by a test.

1. In-flight cap: a tower layer backed by `Arc<AtomicUsize>` gating `/v1/check` only. Excludes `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`, and 401-fast-path rejections (auth runs *before* the gate).
2. 413 at both raw-body (64 KiB, via `tower_http::limit::RequestBodyLimitLayer`) and post-normalization (192 KiB, inside the handler before scan).
3. 503 `overloaded` returns immediately when the gate is full.
4. Unknown-fields pass-through confirmed by test (including the reserved `overrides` key).
5. Error-table test: one test per row of the DESIGN §API error table.

**Exit criteria.** All documented 4xx/5xx paths have a test; `X-List-Version` present on every `/v1/*` response including errors.

## Milestone 6 — Observability

**Goal.** `/metrics` exposes the DESIGN §"Metrics contract" series with correct labels.

1. RED pair (via `axum-prometheus` or an equivalent tower layer), named per DESIGN §"Metrics contract":
   - `bws_requests_total{status}` counter, with `status` bucketed as `2xx` / `4xx` / `5xx`.
   - `bws_request_duration_seconds{status,endpoint}` histogram; `endpoint` ∈ {`/v1/check`, `/v1/languages`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`}.
   Override bucket boundaries via env. The RED layer must sit **outside** the auth layer (see M3 middleware order) so fast-pathed 401s flow through it — DESIGN explicitly requires them to increment both `bws_requests_total{status="4xx"}` and `bws_request_duration_seconds`, in addition to `bws_auth_failures_total`.
2. Custom metrics registered in `observability.rs`:
   - `bws_auth_failures_total{reason}`, `reason` ∈ {`missing`, `invalid`}.
   - `bws_match_duration_seconds{lang,mode}` — observed inside `scan` per lang.
   - `bws_matches_per_request`, `bws_truncated_total`, `bws_input_bytes`.
   - `bws_list_version_info{list_version}` set to 1 at startup.
   - `bws_languages_loaded` gauge, `bws_inflight` gauge (tied to the cap).
3. `tracing-subscriber` with JSON formatter; `RUST_LOG` honored.
4. Test: scrape `/metrics` after a mixed workload, assert label sets and non-zero counters.

**Exit criteria.** Prometheus scrape returns a stable, low-cardinality series set matching DESIGN.

## Milestone 7 — Container, deploy, and config plumbing

**Goal.** Immutable, auditable container.

1. Dockerfile: cargo-chef recipe → builder → `gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian12:nonroot` (or static) final stage. Non-root UID, read-only root FS.
2. Image labels: `org.opencontainers.image.revision`, `list_version` (the LDNOOBW SHA).
3. k8s manifests under `deploy/k8s/`: Deployment, Service, HPA (CPU + `bws_inflight` via custom metric adapter — stubbed), liveness → `/healthz`, readiness → `/readyz`.
4. `README` snippet: env-var table mirrored from DESIGN (single source of truth kept in DESIGN; README links there).

**Exit criteria.** `docker run` locally serves `/v1/check` end-to-end; image size under 30 MB.

## Milestone 8 — Benchmarks and CI perf gates

**Goal.** Regressions fail CI.

1. Criterion benches in `benches/`:
   - 1 KiB reference input, English, strict vs substring.
   - 1 KiB input, all languages scanned.
   - 64 KiB input, English only.
   - Normalization-heavy input (fullwidth + NFKC expansions).
2. CI job runs benches against main and PR, fails if p99 regresses > 10%. Use `critcmp` or a small harness.
3. Load test script (`oha` or `vegeta`) committed under `benches/load/` (same root as the criterion benches; cargo ignores non-`.rs` files there); target p99 < 1 ms on the 1 KiB reference input, single core.

**Exit criteria.** A release-candidate tag produces a bench report checked into the PR description.

## Milestone 9 — v1.0 tag

**Goal.** Ship.

1. Fresh clone + `make docker` reproduces an identical image (modulo timestamps).
2. Load test report attached to the release notes.
3. `X-List-Version` in every response matches the git tag's submodule SHA.
4. Tag `v1.0.0`; cut image `ghcr.io/.../banned-words-service:v1.0.0` and `:$LIST_SHA`.

## Out of scope (tracked, not built)

- Per-tenant overrides — schema already accepts `overrides`; semantics land in v2.
- Leetspeak / homoglyph normalization.
- Multi-tenant rate limiting (belongs in gateway).
- Hot reload of the list (deliberately never).
- Stricter CJK substring matching via a segmentation crate (`lindera` or similar) — revisit only if a caller explicitly asks for it. v1's CJK default is `substring`, and explicit `strict` on CJK is honored but under-matches by design; segmentation-crate dictionaries are multi-megabyte and would bloat the image for a feature no v1 caller has asked for.
- Per-language scan-bytes counter (`bws_scan_bytes_total{lang}`) — existing `bws_match_duration_seconds{lang,mode}` and `bws_input_bytes` cover per-language hot-path cost and aggregate throughput; add only if a dashboard needs absolute byte counts per language that can't be derived from existing series.

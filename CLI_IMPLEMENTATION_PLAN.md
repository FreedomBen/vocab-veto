# Vocab Veto CLI — Implementation Plan

A concrete, milestone-ordered plan for building `vv`, a command-line frontend
to the banned-words service specified in [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md). The CLI
reuses the matcher core verbatim so behavior mirrors the HTTP server exactly;
the differences are the transport (argv + stdio vs HTTP) and the trimmings
(no auth, no metrics, no concurrency gate, no listen socket).

This plan sits alongside [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) —
the server plan — and assumes its milestones M1–M8 are complete (they are).
Do not duplicate matcher, normalizer, or codegen work here; reuse the library.

## Design premise

The value of this CLI is running the matcher with **no running service, no
network, and no runtime dependencies** — a single static binary that accepts
text on stdin or as a flag, emits JSON matching the server's response shape on
stdout, and exits non-zero when there are hits so it works as a shell filter.

Because the server already compiles the LDNOOBW list and matcher logic into
the binary via `build.rs`, the CLI can depend on the same library crate and
pick up new LDNOOBW pins for free on every rebuild. No duplication of the
generated term table, no drift from `DEFAULT_MODE`, no second normalization
path, no second way for the two binaries to disagree.

### What mirrors the server, and what does not

| Aspect                          | Server                                         | CLI                                                     | Note |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Matcher core                    | `matcher::{normalize, boundary, scan}`          | Same crate, same functions                              | No re-implementation. |
| LDNOOBW list                    | Compiled in via `build.rs`                     | Same compiled table                                     | `list_version` is the same SHA in both binaries. |
| `DEFAULT_MODE` table            | 27 entries, strict vs substring per language    | Same table                                              | Per-language defaults identical. |
| Explicit mode wins over default | Yes, no CJK clamping                           | Same                                                    | `strict` on `ja` is honored in both. |
| `mode_used` echo in response    | Every scanned language                         | Same                                                    | Audit trail parity. |
| Alphabetical `langs` default    | Scan every loaded language alphabetically       | Same                                                    | Omitted `--lang` ⇒ all. |
| 256-match cap + `truncated`     | Enforced in `Engine::scan`                      | Same code path                                          | Same cap, same wire field. |
| Reserved `overrides` JSON key   | Silently accepted                              | Same, for `--json-input` mode                           | Schema forward-compatibility. |
| `list_version` in output        | `X-List-Version` header + response body         | Response body only                                      | No HTTP ⇒ no header; JSON body carries it. |
| Bearer auth                     | Required on `/v1/*`                            | N/A                                                     | Local process; trust the invoker. |
| `VV_API_KEYS` / `VV_MAX_INFLIGHT` / `VV_LISTEN_ADDR` / `VV_HISTOGRAM_BUCKETS` | Config-loaded | Ignored | No server, no gate, no metrics. |
| `VV_LANGS` compile-time allowlist | Gates engine load at startup                 | Accepted as `--lang` flag on every invocation instead    | Flag-driven is the CLI idiom; env vars are not. |
| 64 KiB raw-body cap             | `RequestBodyLimitLayer`                         | No cap at input; 192 KiB post-normalization cap applies | CLI inputs are already process-bounded. |
| 413 `payload_too_large`         | Error response                                  | Exit 3 with message on stderr                           | Same underlying `NormalizeError::TooLarge`. |
| Observability (`tracing`, metrics) | JSON logs + Prometheus                       | `--verbose` stderr diagnostics only                     | No metrics, no persistent logs. |

### Non-goals (v1)

- **Remote HTTP client mode.** Deferred to v2. The primary value is
  offline; HTTP piping of `curl | jq` already works against the server and
  the CLI output shape matches `/v1/check`'s body byte-for-byte.
- **Custom dictionaries / user-supplied overrides.** The reserved
  `overrides` key stays reserved in both the server and the CLI — parsed,
  silently discarded. Actual override support lands when the server gets
  it, and reuses the same schema change.
- **Interactive REPL / `--watch` modes.** Shell loops (`while read`) handle
  streaming fine; dedicated modes add surface area without new capability.
- **Shell completions.** `clap_complete` is trivial to add later if
  users ask; not on the critical path.
- **Static Windows / macOS binaries.** Linux-musl is the only target in
  scope; the server ships the same target. Other platforms can be added
  once there is demand.

## Progress

- [ ] **CM1 — Library split and binary scaffold.** `src/lib.rs` re-exports
  the matcher and model types the CLI needs; `src/bin/vv.rs` is a thin
  entry point; `Cargo.toml` grows a `[[bin]] name = "vv"` stanza and a
  single new dep (`clap` with `derive`); `cargo build --release --bin vv`
  produces a runnable binary that prints `--help` and exits.
- [ ] **CM2 — `check` subcommand (local matcher).** End-to-end matching
  with flag-driven text input; JSON output on stdout; exit code reflects
  whether any matches were found.
- [ ] **CM3 — `languages` subcommand and `version` subcommand.** Read-only
  introspection endpoints the server exposes, reproduced as subcommands.
- [ ] **CM4 — Input variants, output formats, error rails.** stdin and
  file input for `check`; `--output plain` and `--output json`; one exit
  code per server error row, documented in the CLI help.
- [ ] **CM5 — Static musl binary, CI, docs.** `make vv` and
  `make vv-static` targets; CI builds and smoke-tests the CLI binary;
  README gets a `## CLI usage` section; `make install` installs both
  binaries by default.

Notes on the split:

- `src/cli.rs` holds the logic and is unit-testable against hand-crafted
  arg vectors; `src/bin/vv.rs` is ten lines that call into it. Mirrors
  how `src/main.rs` is thin and `routes/` / `matcher/` hold the weight.
- No workspace conversion. Single crate, two binaries, shared library.
  If we later need to ship the matcher as a published crate, that is the
  moment to split; not before.

## Milestone CM1 — Library split and binary scaffold

**Goal.** `cargo build --release --bin vv` produces a binary that prints
`--help` text covering the intended subcommand surface.

1. Extend `src/lib.rs` re-exports so downstream binaries can consume the
   matcher without `pub(crate)` gymnastics: `pub use matcher::{Engine,
   Mode, DEFAULT_MODE, NormalizeError};` and `pub use model::*;` and
   `pub use LIST_VERSION;`. Anything already re-exported for the
   integration tests stays as it is. No behavior change for `main.rs`.
2. Add to `Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml
   [[bin]]
   name = "vv"
   path = "src/bin/vv.rs"

   [dependencies]
   clap = { version = "4", features = ["derive"] }
   ```
   `clap` is the only new runtime dep. Rationale: hand-rolled argv
   parsing costs less code now but costs more when we add `--help`,
   `--version`, subcommand dispatch, and per-flag validation. The binary
   size hit is minor and well-precedented (ripgrep, fd, bat all ship
   with clap).
3. Create `src/cli.rs` with a `Cli` struct using clap-derive. Subcommands:
   `Check`, `Languages`, `Version`. Every subcommand can be parsed and
   dispatched to a stub returning `Ok(ExitCode::SUCCESS)` in this
   milestone.
4. Create `src/bin/vv.rs`:
   ```rust
   use banned_words_service::cli;
   fn main() -> std::process::ExitCode { cli::run() }
   ```
5. Unit tests in `src/cli.rs` covering clap's generated parser: each
   subcommand parses; unknown subcommand errors; conflicting input
   flags on `check` (`--text` + `--file`) error before dispatch.

**Exit criteria.** `cargo build --release --bin vv` green;
`./target/release/vv --help` lists all three subcommands; `cargo test
--lib` still passes with the added re-exports.

## Milestone CM2 — `check` subcommand (local matcher)

**Goal.** `echo "text" | vv check --lang en` runs the same matcher the
server runs and writes the same JSON body to stdout.

1. `vv check` flags:
   - `--text <STR>` — inline text. Mutually exclusive with `--file` and
     `--stdin`.
   - `--file <PATH>` — read text from file. `-` is a synonym for stdin.
   - `--stdin` — read text from stdin. If none of `--text`/`--file`/
     `--stdin` is given and stdin is not a TTY, default to stdin; if it
     is a TTY, error (exit 2) with a usage hint. Matches the behavior
     of `jq` and `rg`.
   - `--lang <CODE>` (repeatable; also accepts comma-separated) — the
     `langs` field on the request body. Lowercase, dedup, same rules as
     the server's `langs` field. Omitted ⇒ scan every compiled
     language alphabetically, same as the server default.
   - `--mode <strict|substring>` — the `mode` field. Omitted ⇒
     per-language default from `DEFAULT_MODE`, same as the server.
   - `--json-input <PATH>` — alternative to the individual flags: parse
     the file (or `-` for stdin) as a full `CheckRequest` JSON body,
     exactly the shape the server accepts. Unknown fields including
     `overrides` are silently ignored, matching the server's
     forward-compat stance. Mutually exclusive with `--text`/`--file`/
     `--stdin`/`--lang`/`--mode`.
2. Dispatch calls `Engine::scan(text, &scan_langs, mode)` directly.
   Errors map to exit codes and stderr messages (see CM4); on success,
   serialize a `CheckResponse` via `serde_json::to_writer(stdout())` —
   same struct the server emits, so the wire bytes are identical save
   for whitespace.
3. Exit-code policy for `check`:
   - `0` — no matches, `truncated: false`. Scriptable as "the text is
     clean."
   - `1` — one or more matches, or `truncated: true`. Scriptable as
     "there is at least one hit."
   - Errors use `2`+ per CM4.
   The exit-code bifurcation is intentional: it makes the CLI usable as
   a pre-commit hook without parsing JSON (`vv check --text "$MSG"
   --lang en && commit || reject`).
4. Integration tests in `tests/cli.rs` spawn the compiled binary via
   `assert_cmd` (dev-dep, test-only, not a runtime dep) and cover: the
   Scunthorpe case under strict en (exit 0), explicit strict on CJK is
   honored (exit code reflects hits), fullwidth evasion under
   substring CJK produces matches, `--json-input` with unknown fields
   including `overrides` succeeds, omitted `--lang` scans everything.
   Reuse fixtures where possible from `tests/http.rs`.

**Exit criteria.** `vv check --text "Scunthorpe" --lang en` exits `0`
with an empty matches array; `vv check --text "badword" --lang en`
exits `1` with a non-empty matches array; the JSON body byte-matches
the server's `/v1/check` response shape for the same inputs.

## Milestone CM3 — `languages` and `version` subcommands

**Goal.** Introspection parity with the server's read-only endpoints.

1. `vv languages` emits the same `LanguagesResponse` shape the server
   serves on `GET /v1/languages`: an alphabetical array of `{code,
   default_mode}` objects for every compiled language. Reuses
   `model::LanguagesResponse` directly. Exit 0.
2. `vv version` emits a small JSON object: `{"crate_version": "<from
   CARGO_PKG_VERSION>", "list_version": "<LDNOOBW SHA>"}`. Rationale:
   the server surfaces `list_version` via `X-List-Version` and `/readyz`;
   the CLI has no HTTP response to hang it on, so it gets its own
   subcommand. Exit 0. A plain `vv --version` (clap's built-in) still
   works and prints the crate version; `vv version` is the scriptable
   JSON form.
3. Integration tests assert that `vv languages | jq '.languages | length'`
   equals the compiled language count, and that every `default_mode` is
   one of `"strict"` or `"substring"`.

**Exit criteria.** `vv languages` and `vv version` produce valid JSON
that round-trips through `serde_json::from_str::<LanguagesResponse>` /
an ad-hoc version struct respectively.

## Milestone CM4 — Input variants, output formats, error rails

**Goal.** Every documented server error row has a CLI exit code, and
humans can read the output without `jq`.

1. `--output <json|plain>`, default `json`. `plain` for `check`:
   ```
   <lang>\t<start>-<end>\t<term>\t<matched_text>
   ```
   one TSV row per match, nothing when empty. Sensible for `awk`.
   `plain` for `languages`: one `<code>\t<default_mode>` row per
   language. `version`: plain prints `<crate_version>\t<list_version>`.
2. Exit-code table, published in `vv check --help`:

   | Exit | Meaning                             | Corresponds to server |
   | ---- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------- |
   | `0`  | success, no matches                 | 200 OK, empty matches |
   | `1`  | success, matches found or truncated | 200 OK, hits          |
   | `2`  | invalid usage / malformed JSON       | 400 `bad_request`, 422 `invalid_mode`, 422 `empty_text`, 422 `empty_langs`, 422 `unknown_language` — all collapsed to a single "user error" code on the CLI because argv is one rail, not several |
   | `3`  | input too large (post-normalization) | 413 `payload_too_large` via `NormalizeError::TooLarge` |
   | `64` | I/O error (file unreadable, stdin closed early) | no server equivalent — CLI-specific |
   | `70` | internal error (should not happen)  | 500 `internal` |

   The collapse of 400/422 into a single `2` is deliberate: users
   interpret CLI exit codes coarsely, and stderr carries the specific
   message (`"unknown language: xx"`, etc.). Scripts that need the
   precise reason can parse stderr or use `--output json` with a server
   instead.
3. `--verbose` / `-v` emits tracing-style single-line diagnostics on
   stderr: input length, normalized length, mode resolution, per-lang
   match counts. No `tracing_subscriber` dependency — this is direct
   `eprintln!` with a consistent prefix. Metrics parity is not a goal.
4. Integration tests cover every exit-code row with a triggering
   invocation, plus plain-output parity against hand-asserted bytes.

**Exit criteria.** `vv check --help` documents the exit-code table;
every row is triggered by a test in `tests/cli.rs`.

## Milestone CM5 — Static musl binary, CI, docs

**Goal.** A downloadable `vv` binary that runs anywhere x86_64 Linux
runs, with no dynamic linkage.

1. `Makefile` targets:
   - `make vv` — `cargo build --release --bin vv --locked`.
   - `make vv-static` — `cargo build --release --bin vv --locked
     --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`. Relies on the musl toolchain
     already present in the cargo-chef stage of `deploy/Containerfile`;
     document it in `make help`.
   - `make install` — install both `banned-words-service` and `vv` to
     `$(PREFIX)/bin` (default `/usr/local/bin` per the global PREFIX
     convention). An existing `install` target in the Makefile is
     extended rather than replaced.
   - Update `make help` so the new targets appear in the same table
     format as the rest.
2. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) gains a `cli` job:
   - `cargo build --release --bin vv --locked`
   - `cargo test --test cli --locked` (the integration suite from CM2+)
   - Smoke test: `./target/release/vv check --text "hello" --lang en`
     must exit 0.
   The existing `cargo test --locked` job already covers `src/cli.rs`
   unit tests since they live in the library.
3. README gets a `## CLI usage` section with: one-line intro, two or
   three `vv check` examples showing `--text`, `--file`, and
   `--json-input`, a pointer to `vv --help` for the full surface, and
   an explicit note that the CLI is feature-parity with `/v1/check` and
   `/v1/languages` except for auth, metrics, and the concurrency gate.
   The existing Makefile-targets table in the README gets the new rows.
4. RELEASE.md is amended to mention that the `v1.0.0` tag now ships two
   binaries: the server and `vv`. The reproducibility double-build and
   list-version sanity check apply to both. `vv` appears as a second
   release asset on the GitHub release page.

**Exit criteria.** `ldd ./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/vv`
prints "not a dynamic executable"; `./vv check --text "..." --lang en`
on a fresh Debian slim container (no Rust, no glibc add-ons) runs
without error.

## Open questions to resolve before CM2

- **Binary name.** Decided: `vv`, after the product name Vocab Veto. Short,
  easy to type, and keeps the CLI recognisable as a separate identity from
  the crate (`banned-words-service`, unchanged) and the env-var prefix
  (`VV_*`, renamed from the old `BWS_*` when the project was rebranded as
  Vocab Veto). The two-letter name does not collide with any common POSIX
  utility on a default install.
- **Should `vv check --json-input` accept NDJSON for streaming many
  records in one invocation?** Attractive for pipelines, not on the
  server's API surface so strictly a CLI-only feature. Default: no,
  defer to user request; one-request-per-invocation keeps the CLI a
  transparent analog of one HTTP call.
- **Should `vv check` respect a `VV_LANGS` env var as a default for
  `--lang` when neither the flag nor the input JSON sets it?** Server
  parity would say yes (it is the compile-time allowlist surface).
  Default: no — the CLI's idiom is flag-driven, and the server default
  of "scan all compiled languages" already matches what most scripts
  want. Revisit if users ask.
